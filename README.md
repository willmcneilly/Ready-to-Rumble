This the mini-site I created when applying for an Internship with [Rumble Labs](http://rumblelabs.com/ "Rumble Labs Portfolio"). I've put it on Github to archive the code, but is you find anything useful, feel free to take what you need.

The live site can be found at [rumble.willmcneilly.com](http://rumble.willmcneilly.com/ "Ready to Rumble mini-site")
